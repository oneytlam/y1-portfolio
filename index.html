<h2>Hey There.</h2>
  <h1>This is me.</h1>
<p>I'm from Dunman High School and Hereâ€™s my school website link <a href ="www.dhs.sg"> Dunman High School  </a>. </p>
<br>
<h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>I like to take photographs sometimes; this is my favourite photo:</p>

    <p>I also hope to be a good leader. I was the head prefect in my Primary School and hosted skits. I have surely learnt a lot more from my experiences.
